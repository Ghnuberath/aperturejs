aperturejs
==========

ApertureJS is an open, adaptable and extensible JavaScript visualization framework with supporting REST services, designed to produce visualizations for analysts and decision makers in any common web browser. Aperture utilizes a novel layer based approach to visualization assembly, and a data mapping API that simplifies the process of adaptable transformation of data and analytic results into visual forms and properties.  Aperture vizlets can be easily embedded with full interoperability in frameworks such as the Ozone Widget Framework (OWF).
